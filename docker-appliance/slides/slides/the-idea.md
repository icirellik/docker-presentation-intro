## The Idea

* Docker containers as artifacts
* Works great with cloud providers
* Deliver docker artifacts in a software appliance on-premises

note:

Have your application dockerized

Can spin up environments

 - locally
 - dev and prod environments in a cloud

But now what about a good old fashioned on-premises install? Can you convince a big, old-fashioned, enterprise to run
docker containers?

Software appliance deployment pattern
